<p class="c2"><span class="c6">The </span><span
        class="c6 c13">Pilates</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;method of exercise is taught by many people in many different ways and with various approaches. The method was designed by a man called </span><span
        class="c6 c13">Joseph Pilates</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in the early 1900&rsquo;s. He was a visionary in his advanced approach towards health and fitness and many of his beliefs are considered to be vital to our modern understanding of physical health. &nbsp;As his method has been around for so long, (being taught by many people over many continents and because he drew greatly on many other methods, including Yoga) it is not always easy to explain exactly what Pilates is, however it has certain principles which underlie it.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><img></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">The word &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; is described by the Chambers Concise 20th Century Dictionary as&rdquo;</span><span
        class="c6 c43">.. entireness, wholeness: the unimpaired state of anything: uprightness: honesty: purity&hellip;</span><span
        class="c3">&ldquo;. This definition is I feel, very fitting for the Pilates method as my understanding of Pilates is that it restores or creates body integrity.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">This is achieved through the application of certain principles which underlie the method. One of the most beneficial of these is the </span><span
        class="c6 c13">mind/body</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;aspect which requires that a conscious effort (concentration) is applied to all the exercises. This ensures that an understanding of the body is developed and therefore that the &lsquo;integrity&rsquo;
    that is being developed is something which will exist beyond the studio. Pilates strives to create a body that is able to work without undue tension. Tension is often the root cause of injury and incorrect or imbalanced muscle usage is often the cause of tension. It makes sense therefore that a body which is able to work without undue tension is less likely to be injured and is also likely to work more effectively. This requires concentration and understanding (or mind/body communication), creating a </span><span
        class="c6 c13">strong center</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;/ girdle of strength (by engaging transversus abdominis especially), correct body alignment (e.g.maintaining a neutral pelvis so that the correct muscles are able to work) all of which enable strong, flowing and coordinated movements. Creating a strong center from which this &lsquo;integrity&rsquo;
    can flow is a vital component ofthe Pilates method. No &lsquo;wholeness&rsquo;
    is possible unless there is a strong center from which to develop. The constant requirement of engaging the &lsquo;girdle of strength&rsquo;
    throughout is vital as without it, no </span><span
        class="c6 c13">alignment</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;or coordination would be possible. The body is a complex but closed system and anything that is unbalanced within it will create problems elsewhere in it. A strong center ensures that the body is able to retain its alignment and ensures that the correct muscles for any action are able to be engaged. This brings us to the use of </span><span
        class="c6 c13">relaxation</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><img></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Breathing (i.e. </span><span class="c6 c13">lateral breathing</span><span
        class="c3">) is used as a catalyst for many of these underlying principles. Many disciplines, especially those dealing with relaxation, use breathing as a way of channeling concentration and effort. When you are focused on how you are breathing you are highly unlikely to be thinking about your bank manager at the same time! This allows you to mentally relax which will allow you to focus on the task at hand and will enable physical relaxation to follow. Lateral breathing also frees the rib cage and thoracic spine by creating movement and suppleness which in turn promotes relaxation amongst other things. Also, by breathing through movements, tension is less likely to build up and distort the body&rsquo;s alignment, thereby also ensuring that the movements can flow gracefully. Breathing laterally is also one of the best ways of creating a &lsquo;girdle of strength&rsquo;
    as an out breath reminds one to engage transversus abdominis which is one of the most important posture stabilising muscles.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c6">Very few people have a body without flaws. We all have a basic structure with inherent or created strengths and weaknesses. Stress, injury, aging and illness all take their toll on our bodies. We are however extremely fortunate that we have minds which are able to control our bodies to such a large extent. It is thus the </span><span
        class="c6 c13">mind / body</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;aspect of Pilates which makes it so exciting and special as it opens a whole new and largely untapped world to so many of us &ndash; </span><span

<p class="c45"><span class="c3">Please remember that Pilates is a non competitive activity and that its goals might require you to think in a way that you are unused to! It is a slow, accumulative learning process which challenges each individual differently. As such, a positive outlook and a sense of humour will always be welcomed in any lesson. The studio is run on a &lsquo;course&rsquo;
    basis to assist and encourage the discipline required for regular attendance. A course consists of 10 lessons.</span>

</h1>
<p class="c17"><span class="c21">I discovered Pilates through my classical dance training under Jennifer Paynter. Later I went on to qualify as a Pilates Instructor with STOTT Pilates as well as the Pretoria Technikon. My dance and performance training, degree in education and diverse Pilates training have enabled me to assist people to find the best in their bodies; be their goals &lsquo;body beautiful&rsquo;
    or remedial! For your peace of mind, I have attached a reference by Jane Parsons from Active Pilates in the UK. However, I find it best to speak to potential new students in person and invite them to watch how I teach. Your body is your most precious asset after all and you want to be sure you are in the best possible hands!</span>
</p>
<p class="c17"><span class="c21">Its always good to get feedback from our clients. We&rsquo;d like to share with you some of our Pilates success stories! We hope this will inspire you&hellip;</span>

<p class="c2"><span class="c16 c26">Hi Marcelle</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c16 c26">Well just a quick e mail to thank you very much for your help getting me to prepare for my coast to coast mountain bike challenge. &nbsp;I managed the cycle very successfully and although a bit slow for the first few days I had enough stamina to stay the course and as the others got tired and slowed the pace I managed to pick up!! </span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c16 c26">I finished the 6 days coming second in the race the second to last day and all the others are at least 10 years younger!! &nbsp;Deb has helped me to follow your recommendations very carefully and we have worked together on my preparation.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c16 c26">I do the 10 minite warmup before I go out and then 30mins when I get back. &nbsp;While on the actual coast to coast I did spine curls and a couple of other exercises and stretches each evening in the bathroom before having a shower!!I have been back now for a little while and I am feeling very ok, I have started to cycle longer distances and I am feeling fit, Deb says my posture is looking better. &nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t been brave enough to try twisting but will do that soon because I would like to play golf again if I can.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span
        class="c16 c26">Anyway I just wanted to thank you very much</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c16 c30">Love</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I have suffered minor lower back pain since I was 18 years old and this worsened during pregnancies and motherhood. I have also had several falls, twice sitting down hard on my coccyx on hard stone. Six years ago I had an accident at work and fell awkwardly, hurting my back once more.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Three years ago I returned from a three month visit to Australia, where I had been looking after my new grandchild. I guess this and the 2 x 24 hour flights took too much out of me and resulted in the worst back pain in my life when I got home.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I had seen a physiotherapist during problem times before, but now felt I needed extra help and my friend recommended his chiropractor. I was X-rayed and examined and told I had a twisted sacrum (at the base of the spine) with a corresponding twist at the top of my spine. Following several months of manipulation I asked my chiropractor what I could do to help strengthen my back and she suggested Pilates. I found Marcelle&rsquo;s name on the Internet , contacted her and started private classes. Marcelle explained how one&rsquo;s body learned to cope with problems and compensated for them, in my case resulting in a definite &lsquo;lean&rsquo;
    to the left. Marcelle was so patient, having to put me straight before each exercise, and was aware that I was terrified that any movement would bring back the pain.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">After many months I progressed to a class with another &lsquo;problem case&rsquo;
    and the two of us eventually left the &ldquo;remedial&rdquo; class and joined a 4-person group. We are still together!</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">My core stability has improved and I feel confident about using my back now, which means I am not putting a strain on other parts of my body. I also have the best-toned body of my life (not bad for an OAP!) and have so much to thank Marcelle for. My husband is so impressed with the benefits I&rsquo;ve achieved that he is now taking private classes with her!</span>

<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I fractured part of my lower spine in a horse riding accident in March 2002 and was aware that if I wanted to try and regain a pain free back (having never had any problems before) I really needed to take matters into my own hands as the NHS treatment I was receiving was fairly rudimentary.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Having been flat on my back in hospital for one week and then in a back brace for another twelve weeks I was getting about my day to day activities in a limited fashion including having returned to work part time. The worst side effect of my injury was that I was experiencing lower back pain predominantly down the right hand side of my lower back and found it extremely uncomfortable to sit for any period of time and driving more than about 30 minutes proved to be painful.Having learned a little Shiatsu a few years ago I figured that this might be a way of relieving my lower back pain, so I went to an open day the Salisbury Homoeopathy Centre to have a chat with the practitioner there. Marcelle was there talking about Pilates to someone and I started to chat with her. What she said made a lot of sense, especially that the muscles in my back would be trying to &lsquo;protect&rsquo;
    me which could be a reason for the lower back pain. I booked in for 5 private sessions to see if Pilates would be able to help ease my back pain.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">In those first sessions I learned some of the basic principles of Pilates but more importantly I learned about how the body doesn&rsquo;t always work for its own good! My muscles were trying to do one thing that they thought was helping to protect me but it was really just causing me pain. I needed to relearn how to use my body and how my conscious and unconscious thought processes could help or hinder this. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong it also involves quite hard physical work! I moved on from my 5 sessions to another 5 and started to learn the basic Pilates exercises with particular emphasis on those that would help my spine and allow the surrounding muscles to work in a less harmful manner.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Two years later and I&rsquo;m still attending weekly small group sessions. I&rsquo;ve learned lots of things about what my body wants to do incorrectly but now through a better understanding of how my brain and body work I at least feel that I am better equipped to work with my body as opposed to against it. I am now pain free although I do still sometimes get discomfort in my lower back but I have a far greater understanding of what is causing it and some ways of helping to alleviate it and keep it strong. Plus if anyone had ever told me 2 years ago that I would be able to &lsquo;roll like a ball&rsquo;
    I would have laughed but now it (almost) comes naturally!</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I have suffered all my life from a weak back which caused me pain of varying degrees. About 4 years ago I suddenly developed an excruciating pain in my upper back which &lsquo;attacked&rsquo;
    me when playing golf or stretching up or sometimes just bending or turning. I have tried osteopaths, reflexologists, acupuncturists and other experts including a specialist at the NHS Hospital. The Specialist noted a scoliosis in my upper spine and suggested that I used an insert in my right shoe and ended up by saying &ldquo;there is nothing further I can do for you&rdquo;.A few months later my wife read about Pilates body conditioning and went on the web to search for a teacher. Having contacted Marcelle we began a course of private lessons. At first I had to take a stool to sit on as I could not get down on the floor without pain. After a few months I was able to carry out several of the basic exercises correctly and my scoliosis was noticably better, removing the need for the shoe insert.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Eighteen months later and now able to work in a group of four, I am much more flexible and am gaining strength in the muscles which support my spine. I am not yet cured of the condition &ndash;
    fibromyalgia- but the exercises together with massage and acupuncture are working together to make the pain less frequent and my body stronger. The fact that I have persevered with the Pilates lessons is entirely due to the skill, knowledge and encouragement of the teacher and I would urge anyone thinking of taking lessons, to seek a reputable teacher and avoid large classes where you cannot be watched, to ensure that you are carrying out the movements correctly.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The exruciating pain still comes, but I am noticing that after a lesson with Marcelle I am free from it for a day or two. I feel this is great progress and hope that with practise at home to consolidate the lessons that eventually I will be clear of it altogether.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I went to Mrs. Sutton for my back but with her vast knowledge she is able to help with all sorts of ailments. If she is unable to help you she would tell you and not waste your time.</span>
