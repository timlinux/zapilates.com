    <p>ThePilates method of exercise is taught by many people in many different ways and with various approaches. 
        The method was designed by a man called Joseph Pilates in the early 1900's.
        He was a visionary in his advanced approach towards health and fitness and many 
        of his beliefs are considered to be vital to our modern understanding of physical health. 
        As his method has been around for so long, (being taught by many people over many continents 
        and because he drew greatly on many other methods, including Yoga) it is not always easy to explain 
        exactly what Pilates is, however it has certain principles which underlie it.</p>
    
    <p>The word &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; is described by the Chambers Concise 20th Century Dictionary as&rdquo;... 
        entireness, wholeness: the unimpaired state of anything: uprightness: honesty: purity...&ldquo;.
        This definition is I feel, very fitting for the Pilates method as my understanding of 
        Pilates is that it restores or creates body integrity.</p>

    <p>This is achieved through the application of certain principles which underlie the method. 
        One of the most beneficial of these is the mind/body aspect which requires that a conscious 
        effort (concentration) is applied to all the exercises. This ensures that an understanding 
        of the body is developed and therefore that the &lsquo;integrity&rsquo; that is being 
        developed is something which will exist beyond the studio.</p>
    
    <p>Pilates strives to create a body that is able to work without undue tension. Tension 
        is often the root cause of injury and incorrect or imbalanced muscle usage is often 
        the cause of tension. It makes sense therefore that a body which is able to work 
        without undue tension is less likely to be injured and is also likely to work more 
        effectively. This requires concentration and understanding (or mind/body communication), 
        creating a strong center / girdle of strength (by engaging transversus abdominis 
        especially), correct body alignment (e.g.maintaining a neutral pelvis so that 
        the correct muscles are able to work) all of which enable strong, flowing and 
        coordinated movements. Creating a strong center from which this &lsquo;integrity&rsquo;
        can flow is a vital component ofthe Pilates method. No &lsquo;wholeness&rsquo;
        is possible unless there is a strong center from which to develop. The constant requirement 
        of engaging the &lsquo;girdle of strength&rsquo; throughout is vital as without it, no
        alignment or coordination would be possible.</p> 
    
    <p>The body is a complex but closed system and anything that is unbalanced within it 
        will create problems elsewhere in it. A strong center ensures that the body is able to 
        retain its alignment and ensures that the correct muscles for any action are able to be 
        engaged. This brings us to the use of relaxation.</p>
    
    <p>Breathing (i.e. lateral breathing is used as a catalyst for many of these underlying 
        principles. Many disciplines, especially those dealing with relaxation, use breathing 
        as a way of channeling concentration and effort. When you are focused on how you are 
        breathing you are highly unlikely to be thinking about your bank manager at the same 
        time! This allows you to mentally relax which will allow you to focus on the task at 
        hand and will enable physical relaxation to follow. Lateral breathing also frees 
        the rib cage and thoracic spine by creating movement and suppleness which in turn 
        promotes relaxation amongst other things. Also, by breathing through movements, 
        tension is less likely to build up and distort the body&rsquo;s alignment, thereby 
        also ensuring that the movements can flow gracefully. Breathing laterally is also 
        one of the best ways of creating a &lsquo;girdle of strength&rsquo; as an out 
        breath reminds one to engage transversus abdominis which is one of the most 
        important posture stabilising muscles.</p>
    
    <p>Very few people have a body without flaws. We all have a basic structure with 
        inherent or created strengths and weaknesses. Stress, injury, aging and illness 
        all take their toll on our bodies. We are however extremely fortunate that we have 
        minds which are able to control our bodies to such a large extent. It is thus the 
        mind / body of Pilates which makes it so exciting and special as it opens a whole 
        new and largely untapped world to so many of us.</p>
    
    <p>The Pilates method is suitable for all ages and fitness levels. It has proven beneficial 
        for injury rehabilitation, back problems, hip problems and injuries, incontinence, pre 
        and post natal programmes, weight loss, tension, headaches, constipation, insomnia, 
        postural problems, kyphosis/lordosis and for those who dislike or who are unable to 
        do aerobic type exercises. It is a gentle but extremely effective method and is 
        recommended by many chiropractors and physiotherapists.</p>
    
    
    <p>For more information you are welcome to contact me to discuss how the 
        Pilates method can be of benefit to you.</p>
    
    <p>>Please remember that Pilates is a non competitive activity and that its goals might 
        require you to think in a way that you are unused to! It is a slow, 
        accumulative learning process which challenges each individual differently. As such, 
        a positive outlook and a sense of humour will always be welcomed in any lesson. 
        The studio is run on a &lsquo;course&rsquo; basis to assist and encourage the 
        discipline required for regular attendance. A course consists of 10 lessons.</p>
